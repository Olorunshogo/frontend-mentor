# 🎯 Frontend Mentor Projects
A collection of frontend challenges solved from 
[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/),
organized by difficulty and built with clean code, accessibility, responsiveness, and modern UI/UX principles in mind.

This repo is where I explore different frontend techniques while building real-world UIs based on Frontend Mentor challenges. Each project here reflects attention to detail, thoughtful structure, and progressive improvement over time.

## 🗂 Project Categories
Projects are grouped based on the difficulty level specified by Frontend Mentor:

- 🔰 **Beginner**

Simple layouts focusing on core HTML/CSS and basic interactions.
Folder: `/beginner`

- ⚙️ **Intermediate**

Projects that require more dynamic behavior, JavaScript logic, and component-driven thinking.
Folder: `/intermediate`

- 🚀 **Advanced**

These are larger projects with more moving parts, often requiring state management, API integration, and higher-level architectural decisions.
Folder: `/advanced`
