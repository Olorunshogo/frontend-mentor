- Browse a 7-day weather forecast with daily high/low temperatures and weather icons
- View an hourly forecast showing temperature changes throughout the day
- Switch between different days of the week using the day selector in the hourly forecast section
- Toggle between Imperial and Metric measurement units via the units dropdown 
- Switch between specific temperature units (Celsius and Fahrenheit) and measurement units for wind speed (km/h and mph) and precipitation (millimeters) via the units dropdown
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. 
Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('üéâ')
}
```


- Implementing dynamic filtering with `computed()` in Vue 3.
- Leveraging watchEffect() for reactive data assignment with Nuxt's `useFetch`.
- Managing dark/light theme integration with `@nuxtjs/color-mode`.
- SEO setup using `useSeoMeta` for Open Graph and Twitter preview cards.
- Building scalable, modular, and accessible components using ShadCN's UI architecture.


### Further Improvements

- Add drag-and-drop sorting for extensions
- Implement persistence via localStorage or a backend
- Create an edit option for extension details
- Add unit and E2E tests using Vitest + Playwright
- Improve accessibility (ARIA roles and keyboard navigation)
- Optimize performance for large extension lists (e.g., virtualization)
- Add user authentication for personalized extension management
- Integrate with real browser extension APIs for live data
- Implement bulk actions (activate/deactivate/remove multiple extensions)
